# 📝 Project Report: FarminAI Assistant

---

## 📌 1. Introduction

**FarminAI Assistant** is an AI-powered Streamlit application developed to assist farmers in three key areas:

- **Disease Detection** (Poultry, Cow, Crop)
- **Farm Record Keeping**
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**

This tool aims to improve agricultural productivity, reduce losses due to undetected diseases, and digitize farm operations for better decision-making.

## 🎯 2. Objectives

- ✅ Provide real-time disease diagnosis support using AI
- ✅ Create an intuitive dashboard for farm management
- ✅ Enable simple digital record keeping
- ✅ Support multiple disease detection modules
- ✅ Design a modular and scalable system

## 🧩 3. Problem Statement

In many rural and semi-urban areas, farmers struggle with:

- Lack of early disease detection systems
- Poor access to veterinary/agronomic expertise
- Manual record-keeping that is error-prone or non-existent
- Limited digital tools tailored for local agriculture practices

FarminAI addresses these challenges by providing an interactive, AI-driven, easy-to-use assistant.

## 🔧 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Tools & Frameworks
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Framework:** Streamlit for the frontend
- **ML (Planned):** TensorFlow / PyTorch for disease detection models
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, PIL, pandas (assumed for future features)
- **Storage:** Local CSV (for record keeping, in future: SQLite or Firebase)
